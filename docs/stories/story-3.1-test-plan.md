      id: "uuid-1",
      title: "Contr√¥le UML",
      class_id: "class-uuid",
      subject_id: "subject-uuid",
      school_year_id: "year-uuid",
      exam_date: "2025-10-20",
      max_points: 20,
      coefficient: 1.5,
      exam_type: "contr√¥le",
      is_published: false,
      created_at: "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z",
      updated_at: "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  next_cursor: null
}

// POST /exams request
{
  title: "Nouveau contr√¥le",
  class_id: "class-uuid",
  subject_id: "subject-uuid",
  school_year_id: "year-uuid",
  exam_date: "2025-11-15",
  max_points: 20,

{
  error: "Validation failed",
  message: "Le titre est requis",

}
```

## Test Implementation Notes

1. **Mock API Client**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) or similar to intercept API calls
2. **Mock useToast**: Mock toast notifications to verify they're called with correct messages
3. **Mock useClassSelection**: Provide test context with mock selectedClassId
4. **Date Handling**: Use fixed dates in tests to ensure consistency
5. **Async Testing**: Use waitFor/act properly for async operations
6. **Test Isolation**: Reset mock state between tests

## Future Test Enhancements

- [ ] Add visual regression tests (Percy, Chromatic)
- [ ] Add accessibility tests (jest-axe)
- [ ] Add performance budgets
- [ ] Add load testing (k6, Artillery)
- [ ] Add security tests (SQL injection, XSS)
